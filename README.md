# 66DaysOfData
I'm looking to start holding myself accountable when it comes to daily studying. I can use this area to journal the things I work on everyday as motivation to continue studies.
<br>
<br>
Day 1: 
<br>
Started the pre-processing section of the [Machine Learning A-Z Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WfW3@QgDKzuZ0c01GKZEKvgjVgdyEVvRLSSaiaIlJf2drsLlv_A9pNBlTbJLtlcyGr1K7/). Only got through importing data and taking care of missing data. Uses SimpleImputer to replace null values with the average mean.
<br>
Applied pre-processing topic to the [Titanic problem](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) on Kaggle.
<br>
<br>
Day 2:
<br>
Watched [Interview with Spotify Data Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-TtxkmWEZA). Spotify is my dream job so this is pretty good insight.
<br> 
Continued working on [Machine Learning A-Z Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WfW3@QgDKzuZ0c01GKZEKvgjVgdyEVvRLSSaiaIlJf2drsLlv_A9pNBlTbJLtlcyGr1K7/). Encoded categorical variables and splitting test and train data.
<br>
<br>
Day 3:
<br>
Finished the pre-processing part of [Machine Learning A-Z Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WfW3@QgDKzuZ0c01GKZEKvgjVgdyEVvRLSSaiaIlJf2drsLlv_A9pNBlTbJLtlcyGr1K7/). 
<br>
Will start logistic regression section tomorrow so that I can apply it to the [Titanic problem](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) to make a prediction. 
<br>
Watched Ken Jee's video on [5 Impactful Data Science Projects For Your Portfolio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMP858aZcow). Might do some visualizations using FBI crime data.
<br>
Also, want to look into using reinforcement learning for fighting games. Hate playing fighting games so why not let them fight for me.
<br>
<br>
Day 4:
<br>
Worked on Logistic Regression Intuition for A-Z. Will use this on Titanic.
<br>
Watch this video on [AI Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxQDG6WQT5s&list=WL&index=114). Want to do dis.
<br>
<br>
Day 5:
<br>
Everyday is technically a data day for me. :')
<br>
Worked on the Logistic Regression workflow. Got all the way to feature scaling. Will work on training tomorrow.
<br>
<br>
Day 6:
<br>
Watched Tina Huang video on [the death of data science])(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqvyWUODZGE). Was an ad. COPIUM. My job will not be automated. COPIUM
<br>
<br>
Day 7: 
<br>
Watched [video on GCP DE exam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bedzsHNSKnA). Will study for this cert boy-o.<br>
Also watched this video on [5 Steps to becoming ML Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMMDPzECrf0).<br>
Started [Elements of AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/1) course. Learned three applications: autonomous driving, recommendation, image and video processing.<br>
Enrolled in GCP DE Learning path.<br>
<br>
Day 8:<br>
I finished [Section 1 of Chapter 1 of Element of AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/1/1). Got a 7/7 on the assessment. Ayy!<br>
I finished [Section 2 of Chapter 1 of Elements of AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/1/2). Perfect on the first assessment. Scammed in the second. Machine Learning is essentially statistics so every answer that has machine learnign by default be statistics as well. Sadge
<br>
<br>
Day 9:<br>
I watched the beginning of a [PyTorch Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_ikDlimN6A&t=518s).<br>
Read [Philosophy of AI](https://course.elementsofai.com/1/3). Eugene Goostman fools boomers.<br>
<br>
Day 10:
[Incredible video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVcsDDABEkM&t=607s)
