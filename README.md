# 66DaysOfData
I'm looking to start holding myself accountable when it comes to daily studying. I can use this area to journal the things I work on everyday as motivation to continue studies.
<br>
<br>
Day 1: 
<br>
Started the pre-processing section of the [Machine Learning A-Z Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WfW3@QgDKzuZ0c01GKZEKvgjVgdyEVvRLSSaiaIlJf2drsLlv_A9pNBlTbJLtlcyGr1K7/). Only got through importing data and taking care of missing data. Uses SimpleImputer to replace null values with the average mean.
<br>
Applied pre-processing topic to the [Titanic problem](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) on Kaggle.
<br>
<br>
Day 2:
<br>
Watched [Interview with Spotify Data Scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-TtxkmWEZA). Spotify is my dream job so this is pretty good insight.
<br> 
Continued working on [Machine Learning A-Z Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WfW3@QgDKzuZ0c01GKZEKvgjVgdyEVvRLSSaiaIlJf2drsLlv_A9pNBlTbJLtlcyGr1K7/). Encoded categorical variables and splitting test and train data.

Day 3:
<br>
Finished the pre-processing part of [Machine Learning A-Z Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WfW3@QgDKzuZ0c01GKZEKvgjVgdyEVvRLSSaiaIlJf2drsLlv_A9pNBlTbJLtlcyGr1K7/). 
<br>
Will start logistic regression section tomorrow so that I can apply it to the [Titanic problem](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/overview) to make a prediction. 
<br>
Watched Ken Jee's video on [5 Impactful Data Science Projects For Your Portfolio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMP858aZcow). Might do some visualizations using FBI crime data.
<br>
Also, want to look into using reinforcement learning for fighting games. Hate playing fighting games so why not let them fight for me.
